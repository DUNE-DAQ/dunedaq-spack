* Deploy

Deployment needs discussion among stakeholders and there may be more
than one solution depending on needs.

The Spack *installation* is simply a directory of binaries (like a UPS
products area). 

Some possible options:

- CVMFS :: deploy an "official" Spack *installation* via CVMFS to the world
- NFS :: or other local network file system
- rsync :: simply rsync the Installation from a development account to a deployment area
- diy :: build and use the software stack for yourself
