Spack supports a number of ways to use a Spack *installation*.

** Modules in Spack

Spack supports "environment modules" which may be loaded directly from
Spack's environment.  

#+begin_example
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack load dunedaqapps@0.0.1
daq_application [...args...]
#+end_example

** Modules outside of Spack

You can extract the shell setup so that one need not run inside the
Spack shell environment.

#+begin_example
command spack load --sh dunedaqapps@0.0.1 > ddq-load.sh
source ddq-load.sh
daq_application [...args...]
#+end_example

** Views

Instead of using environment, Spack can use the file system to
aggregate the many packages into a simple *view*.

#+begin_example
spack view add -i /path/to/my/view dunedaqapps@0.0.1
PATH=/path/to/my/view:$PATH
daq_application [...args...]
#+end_example

Once made, the *view* may be used either inside or outside the Spack
shell environment.

** UPS

In principle, one may generate UPS "table" files from Spack info in a
similar manner as is done for environment modules.  This is left as an
exercise to the interested user.
