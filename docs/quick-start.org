* Quick Start

First, quick start for Spack itself:

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
#+end_example

And, adding the DUNE DAQ Spack repository

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/dunedaq-spack.git
spack repo add dunedaq-spack
#+end_example

Let's build a stack of software!

#+begin_example
spack info dunedaqapps
spack install dunedaqapps@0.0.1
#+end_example

This builds ~dunedaqapps~ which is a Spack "bundle" package.  It does
not provide any code but simply depends on the various DUNE DAQ
packages and through them the full dependency tree.
